# Initial setup

This is a step-by-step guide to deploy this (Kusama API) service in a minikube cluster. Internally, at LocalCoinSwap, we have deployed to AWS EKS with Fargate. There's a separate documentation for it. This document is meant for more general use.

## Minikube kubernetes cluster setup

Although some familiarity with Kubernetes would help understand and make sense of the commands we run, this guide assumes minimal pre-requisites.

### Install command-line utilities

  - [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Install minikube

Linux:

```bash
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 && chmod +x minikube
sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin
```

macOS:

```bash
brew cask install minikube
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube
sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin
```

### Build docker image of the service for production

We'll use Docker Hub to host our kusama-api image. Let's initialize a few env variables for that.

```
export CONTAINER_REPO=ivarojha # Update this with your dockerhub username
export IMAGE_NAME=kusama-api
export COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
export CLUSTER_NAME=kusamacluster
```

Build the prod image

```
CONTAINER_REPO=$CONTAINER_REPO IMAGE_NAME=$IMAGE_NAME COMMIT_HASH=$COMMIT_HASH docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml build
```

Push to the built image to docker hub

```
docker push $CONTAINER_REPO/$IMAGE_NAME:$COMMIT_HASH
```

### Create minikube cluster

```
minikube start -p $CLUSTER_NAME --extra-config=apiserver.enable-swagger-ui=true --alsologtostderr
```

`CLUSTER_NAME` deliberately doesn't contain `-` because that's not supported. Be patient, this command will take some time.

You can open the cluster dashboard for visual overview. Run this in a new terminal tab.

```
minikube -p $CLUSTER_NAME dashboard
```

### Create a deployment in cluster

Check the file `kubernetes/kusama-api-deployment.yaml` in the repo. It is parameterised but there's a strightforward way to pass env variables to it, so we make use of `envsubst` package.

```
envsubst < kubernetes/kusama-api-deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>

```bash
[ravi@ojha-thinkpad:~/_code_/lcs/kusama-api]$ envsubst < kubernetes/kusama-api-deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
deployment.apps/kusama-api-deployment created
```
</details>

If everything went well, you should see two new pods in the cluster. Check the dashboard or use `kubectl get pods` in terminal.


### Scaling horizontally

Let's say we want to increase the number of pods running in the cluster. We can easily scale by running:

```
kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment kusama-api-deployment
```

Here `kusama-api-deployment` is the name of our deployment. It is defined in `kubernetes/kusama-api-deployment.yaml` file.


### Attach a load balancer

Depending on the vendor and configuration, there maybe different ways to attach the load balancer. In minikube, we can create a load balancer service with following config. Internally, we have deployed on AWS Kubernetes Cluster and we used Ingress controller to route the traffic inside cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: lb
  labels:
    name: lb
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    name: kusama-api
  type: LoadBalancer
```

For now, let's create a LoadBalancer service.

```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/minikube-kusama-api-service.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>

```bash
[ravi@ojha-thinkpad:~/_code_/lcs/kusama-api]$ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/minikube-kusama-api-service.yaml
service/lb created
```
</details>


### Accessing API endpoint

First, get the cluster IP.

```
[roy@miller-thinkpad:~/_code_/lcs/kusama-api]$ minikube -p $CLUSTER_NAME ip
172.17.0.3
```

Then, get the port exposed by loadbalancer in your local by `kubectl get services`

```
[ravi@ojha-thinkpad:~/_code_/lcs/kusama-api]$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        67m
lb           LoadBalancer   10.98.178.131   <pending>     80:31072/TCP   25s
```

Try to access the endpoint `http://172.17.0.3:31072/HeartBeat`

```
[roy@miller-thinkpad:~/_code_/lcs/kusama-api|master *]$ curl "http://172.17.0.3:31072/HeartBeat"
true
```

That's it! We have successfully deployed within a minikube cluster on local. This is just a one-time setup. Follow along for how to make future builds and deployments.


## Deploying new image to production as pods

### Building for production

```
export CONTAINER_REPO=ivarojha # Update this with your dockerhub username
export IMAGE_NAME=kusama-api
export COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
CONTAINER_REPO=$CONTAINER_REPO IMAGE_NAME=$IMAGE_NAME COMMIT_HASH=$COMMIT_HASH docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml build
```

### Push the image to container repo

```
docker push $CONTAINER_REPO/$IMAGE_NAME:$COMMIT_HASH
```

### Initiate a rolling deployment

```
kubectl edit deployments.apps/kusama-api-deployment
```

It'll open up default editor. Look for the container repo and image name. Change the image tag and save & exit. It will start rolling deployment without causing any outage.
